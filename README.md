# Recursive Descent Parser in C

## Overview
This project implements a recursive descent parser in C along with a custom lexical analyzer.  
It is designed to parse simple expressions and demonstrate core concepts from compiler design.

## Features
- Lexical analysis (tokenization of input)
- Recursive descent parsing based on grammar rules
- Syntax validation and basic error handling

## Concepts Used
- Compiler design fundamentals
- Recursive descent parsing
- Lexical analysis
- C programming and memory management

## How to Build and Run
```bash
make
./front
